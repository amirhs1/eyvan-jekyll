> **Note:** This post was generated with OpenAI's ChatGPT for the sole purpose of demonstrating the rich typographic and mathematical capabilities of the Eyvan Jekyll template.

A good portfolio template should feel almost invisible. It should frame the work, make writing comfortable to read, and give the site owner enough structure to keep growing without turning every new page into a design project. That is the central idea behind **eyvan-jekyll**: a minimalist Jekyll template for portfolios, research notes, technical writing, and project archives[^1].

The name comes from the architectural idea of an _eyvan_: an open, vaulted threshold that sits between inside and outside. That metaphor fits the template well. A portfolio is also a threshold. It is not only a private archive, and it is not only a public résumé. It is a framed space where writing, projects, identity, and navigation meet.[^1]

This post explains how the template is organized, why the architecture is intentionally simple, and how the design system supports content-heavy posts without depending on a JavaScript framework.

## Design philosophy

### Content first, decoration second

The template is designed around one simple rule: the content should always win. Headings, body text, figures, tables, code blocks, and project cards are the main interface. Decorative effects are allowed only when they improve orientation, hierarchy, or clarity.

That is why the visual language is restrained. The layout uses generous spacing, readable line lengths, clear section rhythm, and a small set of reusable components. Instead of using heavy animations or complex page transitions, the design relies on structure: containers, grids, cards, captions, and navigation landmarks.

The goal is not to make every page look identical. The goal is to make every page feel like it belongs to the same system.

### Minimal does not mean empty

Minimal design is sometimes confused with removing everything. In this template, minimal means removing what does not help the reader. The site still includes a real header, social links, a theme toggle, project cards, post metadata, table of contents support, responsive media, captions, tags, and related posts. The difference is that each piece has a clear job.

The design avoids over-styling Markdown output. A table should look like a table. A figure should look like a figure. A code block should be easy to scan. The template adds enough visual treatment to make these elements professional, but not so much that the styling competes with the content.

### No JavaScript framework

The site does not need React, Vue, Svelte, or a frontend build pipeline. Jekyll already provides the core content model: layouts, includes, data files, Markdown rendering, Sass compilation, and static output. For a portfolio site, that is usually enough.

This keeps the mental model small:

1. Write content in Markdown.
2. Add metadata in front matter.
3. Compose pages with Liquid layouts and includes.
4. Style the system with SCSS.
5. Build and deploy a static site.

That simplicity matters because the best portfolio architecture is the one you will actually maintain.

## Technology stack

The stack is deliberately conservative. Each tool solves a specific problem and avoids unnecessary moving parts.

{% include table-caption.html
   id="tbl-stack"
   caption="Core technologies used by eyvan-jekyll."
%}

| Tool              | Role                   | Why it belongs                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Jekyll            | Static site generator  | Converts Markdown, layouts, includes, Sass, and data files into a deployable static site.              |
| Liquid            | Template language      | Handles reusable includes, conditional rendering, loops, and page metadata.                            |
| kramdown with GFM | Markdown engine        | Supports GitHub-flavored Markdown patterns, automatic heading IDs, tables, footnotes, and math output. |
| MathJax           | Math renderer          | Enables LaTeX-style inline and display math on pages that opt in with `math: true`.                    |
| `jekyll/tagging`  | Tag archive generation | Creates browsable topic pages for posts and projects.                                                  |
| `jekyll-sitemap`  | SEO support            | Generates a sitemap for search engines.                                                                |
| SCSS              | Styling language       | Provides variables, mixins, partial organization, and compiled CSS.                                    |
| GitHub Actions    | Build pipeline         | Builds the site with plugins that GitHub Pages does not process by default.                            |

The most important architectural choice is that the stack is **Jekyll-first**. Features are built with layouts, includes, front matter, and SCSS before reaching for custom JavaScript. JavaScript is used only where it improves behavior: theme initialization, mobile navigation, table of contents interaction, cross-references, or conditional third-party loading.

The front matter and config are the control panel. For example, posts use the `post` layout by default, sharing is enabled by default, and read time is controlled globally:

```yaml
# _config.yml
markdown: kramdown

kramdown:
  auto_ids: true
  input: GFM
  math_engine: mathjax

plugins:
  - jekyll-sitemap
  - jekyll/tagging

defaults:
  - scope:
      type: posts
    values:
      layout: post
      share: true

sass:
  sass_dir: _sass
  style: compressed

words_per_minute: 200
read_time: true
```

## CSS architecture

The stylesheet architecture follows **ITCSS**: Inverted Triangle CSS. The idea is to organize styles from the most abstract and widely shared rules to the most specific utilities and overrides. This makes the cascade easier to reason about because low-level decisions appear early and component-specific decisions appear later.

In this template, the merged SCSS layer files are:

{% include table-caption.html
   id="tbl-itcss"
   caption="ITCSS layers and their responsibilities."
%}

| Layer      | File                      | Role                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Settings   | `_sass/0-settings.scss`   | Design tokens: colors, spacing, typography, breakpoints, radii, shadows, and configuration values.                             |
| Tools      | `_sass/1-tools.scss`      | Mixins, functions, and helpers used by later layers.                                                                           |
| Generic    | `_sass/2-generic.scss`    | Resets, box sizing, global normalization, and low-specificity baseline rules.                                                  |
| Base       | `_sass/3-base.scss`       | Default element styling for HTML, body, headings, links, media, and form basics.                                               |
| Objects    | `_sass/4-objects.scss`    | Reusable layout patterns such as containers, grids, hero structure, site header layout, site footer layout, and prose measure. |
| Components | `_sass/5-components.scss` | Specific UI components such as buttons, nav, cards, hero, post layout, TOC, media figures, and theme toggle.                   |
| Layouts    | `_sass/6-layouts.scss`    | Page-level composition for the homepage, projects page, tag pages, and default shell spacing.                                  |
| Trumps     | `_sass/7-trumps.scss`     | Utilities, state helpers, and high-priority overrides.                                                                         |

This structure separates **what something is** from **where it sits**. For example, `.c-button` controls button appearance, while `.l-projects__tags-list` controls the spacing of tag links on the projects page. That distinction prevents component styles from becoming tangled with page-specific layout rules.

### BEM naming style

The class naming follows a practical BEM pattern with prefixes:

```scss
.c-post-card {
}
.c-post-card__title {
}
.c-post-card__meta {
}
.c-post-card--featured {
}

.o-grid {
}
.o-grid__item {
}
.o-grid__item--span-6 {
}

.l-projects {
}
.l-projects__archive {
}

.u-visually-hidden {
}
.is-active {
}
```

The prefix communicates the layer at a glance:

- `c-` means component
- `o-` means layout object
- `l-` means page layout
- `u-` means utility
- `is-` means state

This keeps templates readable. When you see `o-grid`, you know it handles layout. When you see `c-post-card`, you know it is a styled component. When you see `l-homepage`, you know it is page-specific composition.

## Layout system

### The container

The `.o-container` object controls horizontal page width. It gives pages a consistent outer frame so that the header, hero, project archive, post cover image, and footer align visually.

A typical page starts like this:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="o-container">
  <div class="l-projects">
    <!-- page content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}

The container is intentionally boring. That is a strength. It creates a stable page boundary without mixing in card styles, text styles, or page-specific spacing.

### The grid

The `.o-grid` object provides a 12-column responsive grid. Items span all 12 columns by default, then use modifiers such as `o-grid__item--span-tablet-6` or `o-grid__item--span-desktop-6` for wider screens.

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="o-grid">
  {% for post in site.posts limit:6 %}
  <div
    class="o-grid__item o-grid__item--span-12 o-grid__item--span-tablet-6 o-grid__item--span-desktop-6"
  >
    {% include post-card.html post=post %}
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```

{% endraw %}

The result is a reusable grid system that works for project cards, homepage sections, and broad layout composition.

### The prose measure

Long-form reading depends on line length. If text is too wide, the reader loses their place. If text is too narrow, the rhythm becomes choppy. The `.o-prose` object solves that by constraining the measure of article content.

The post layout applies:

```html
<div class="o-prose o-prose--measure-wide">
  <!-- rendered Markdown content -->
</div>
```

This allows code blocks, tables, figures, paragraphs, lists, and headings to share a consistent reading rhythm.

### The 3-column post layout

The post layout uses a three-column desktop structure:

```text
left gutter | prose column | table of contents
```

The left gutter is intentionally empty. It balances the right-side table of contents so the prose remains visually centered. On smaller screens, the layout collapses into a single column and the table of contents becomes a mobile/tablet toolbar and panel.

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="c-post-layout">
  <div
    class="c-post-layout__col c-post-layout__col--left"
    aria-hidden="true"
  ></div>

  <div class="c-post-layout__col c-post-layout__col--main">
    <div class="c-post-layout__prose">
      <div class="o-prose o-prose--measure-wide">{{ content }}</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="c-post-layout__col c-post-layout__col--right">
    {% include post-toc-desktop.html %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}

This is one of the template’s most important design decisions. It supports long articles without making the page feel crowded. The reader gets a focused article column, while the TOC remains available for orientation.

## Component inventory

The template is built from small components that can be reused across layouts. The table below lists the major `c-*` components and their purpose.

<table class="c-prose-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Component</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <th>Typical location</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c-brand</code></td>
      <td>Logo, name, and role link used as the site identity.</td>
      <td>Header, footer, mobile menu</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c-site-header</code></td>
      <td>Global header shell for brand, navigation, theme toggle, and actions.</td>
      <td>Default layout</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c-nav</code></td>
      <td>Primary navigation list with desktop and mobile modifiers.</td>
      <td>Header, mobile menu</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c-mobile-menu</code></td>
      <td>Responsive expanded navigation for smaller screens.</td>

      <td>Optional cover image area above the article header.</td>
      <td>Post layout</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Three-column article composition with left gutter, prose, and TOC.</td>
      <td>Post layout</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c-toc</code></td>
      <td>Desktop table of contents navigation.</td>
      <td>Post layout</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c-mobile-toc</code></td>
      <td>Mobile/tablet table of contents panel.</td>
      <td>Post layout</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c-prose-figure</code></td>
      <td>Responsive images, galleries, audio, and video with captions.</td>
      <td>Markdown posts via includes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c-prose-table</code></td>
      <td>Styled Markdown or HTML tables inside long-form content.</td>
      <td>Markdown posts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>c-site-footer</code></td>
      <td>Minimal footer with brand, metadata, and social links.</td>
      <td>Default layout</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This inventory is useful because it creates a shared vocabulary. Instead of thinking “the thing that appears below the hero,” you can think “section heading plus grid plus post cards.” That makes changes easier to scope.

## Feature flags

Many post features are controlled by front matter. This keeps content files explicit and avoids loading unnecessary features on every page.

### Enable math

Use `math: true` only when a post contains LaTeX-style math. For example, the template can render a simple performance ratio such as $R = \frac{content}{chrome}$ when MathJax is enabled.

```yaml
math: true
```

The useful part is conditional loading: a non-math essay does not need MathJax, so it should not pay for MathJax.

### Enable the table of contents

Use `toc: true` for long posts with many headings.

```yaml
toc: true
```

A post like this one is a good stress test because it contains many second- and third-level headings. The desktop TOC improves scanning, and the mobile TOC keeps the same navigation available without permanently occupying screen space.

### Disable sharing

Sharing is enabled by default for posts, but you can turn it off when a page should feel private, internal, or reference-like.

```yaml
share: false
```

This is a good example of a feature flag that supports tone. Not every page needs the same interface.

### Control read time

Read time is controlled globally, but individual templates can still respect a page-level decision if you choose to support that pattern.

```yaml
read_time: true
```

The global configuration uses a words-per-minute value, which keeps the estimate predictable across the site.

## Build and performance

Static sites are fast by default, but performance still depends on restraint. This template uses several small decisions that add up.

### Compressed Sass output

The Sass configuration outputs compressed CSS:

```yaml
sass:
  sass_dir: _sass
  style: compressed
```

That keeps the final CSS smaller while preserving readable source SCSS in the repository.

### Lazy-loaded post images

Post cover images use `loading="lazy"`, which allows the browser to delay loading images until they are needed. Media includes for figures and embeds also default toward lazy behavior where appropriate.

{% raw %}

```html
<img
  class="c-post-cover__image"
  loading="lazy"
  src="{{ page.image | relative_url }}"
  alt="{{ page.image_alt | default: page.title | escape }}"
/>
```

{% endraw %}

The exception is the homepage hero image, which can use eager loading and high fetch priority because it appears above the fold.

### Async MathJax

MathJax is loaded asynchronously and only when the page opts in:

{% raw %}

```html
{% if page.math %}
<script>
  window.MathJax = {
    tex: {
      inlineMath: [
        ["$", "$"],
        ["\\(", "\\)"],
      ],
      displayMath: [
        ["$$", "$$"],
        ["\\[", "\\]"],
      ],
      processEscapes: true,
    },
  };
</script>

<script
  id="MathJax-script"
  async
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"
></script>
{% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

This is the right tradeoff for a mixed portfolio. Some posts need equations; many do not.

### Conditional integrations

The head include centralizes SEO, canonical links, feed discovery, Open Graph metadata, Twitter card metadata, favicons, theme-color handling, stylesheet loading, and optional analytics. Analytics loads only when a measurement ID exists, which keeps local development and early templates clean.

## Extension points

A good template should be easy to extend without rewriting its architecture. In eyvan-jekyll, the safest extension points are layouts, includes, data files, and SCSS components.

### Add a new layout

Create a new file in `_layouts`, then compose existing objects and components.

{% raw %}

```html
---
layout: default
---

<div class="o-container">
  <div class="l-notes">
    {% include section-heading.html id="notes-title" heading_level="h1"
    title=page.title description=page.description %}

    <div class="o-prose o-prose--measure-wide">{{ content }}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}

Then add layout-specific spacing in the layouts layer:

```scss
/* --- ################################################ --- */
/* --- Sub-file: _notes.scss --- */

.l-notes {
  display: grid;
  gap: var(--space-6);
}
```

### Add a new component

For a new component, start with a focused include and one component block. Do not put page layout into the component unless the component truly owns that layout.

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="c-callout c-callout--{{ include.type | default: 'note' }}">
  {% if include.title %}
  <p class="c-callout__title">{{ include.title }}</p>
  {% endif %}

  <div class="c-callout__body">{{ include.content | markdownify }}</div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}

```scss
/* --- ################################################ --- */
/* --- Sub-file: _callout.scss --- */

.c-callout {
  padding: var(--space-4);
  border: 1px solid var(--color-border);
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  background: var(--color-surface-raised);
}

.c-callout__title {
  margin-block: 0 var(--space-2);
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Add a new include

Includes should do one job. For example, the figure include renders image figures; the audio include renders audio; the video include renders video. This is better than one enormous media include with too many modes.

A good include has:

1. A short purpose comment.
2. Clear required parameters.
3. Safe defaults.
4. Accessible output.
5. BEM classes that match the component layer.

### Add new data-driven navigation

Navigation is data-driven, so adding links should happen in the navigation data file rather than hard-coding links into the header. The navigation include handles internal URLs, external links, active states, and development-only items.

That keeps the header focused on composition and the navigation focused on rendering links.

## Why this architecture works

The architecture works because it divides responsibility clearly.

Jekyll owns content generation. Liquid owns composition. Front matter owns page-level decisions. `_config.yml` owns site-level defaults. SCSS owns visual systems. ITCSS controls the cascade. BEM keeps classes understandable. Small includes keep markup reusable. The post layout gives long-form writing a stable reading experience.

Most importantly, the template does not try to become an application. It remains a static portfolio system. That restraint is what makes it maintainable.

For a personal portfolio, the hardest problem is rarely technical complexity. The harder problem is consistency over time: adding new posts, updating projects, changing navigation, improving design, and keeping the site coherent as it grows. eyvan-jekyll solves that by providing a simple architecture with clear extension points.

The result is a site that feels calm, readable, and professional: content framed, not boxed; structure visible, but unobtrusive.
