Goal: turn the button inventory into a clean SCSS file plan you can implement.

**Overview**

For this project, I would keep **all actual button UI in `5-components`** and keep `4-objects` free of button cosmetics. The only thing that might belong in `4-objects` is an optional **layout-only action group object** if you want a reusable wrapper for arranging buttons side by side. That matches your current markup: the real controls are all `c-*` classes, while the wrappers are mostly `o-*` or page/component containers.  

## Recommended file plan

## 1) `4-objects/_actions.scss` — optional

Use this **only if** you want a reusable layout primitive for action rows.

Put here:

* `.o-actions`
* `.o-actions--center`
* `.o-actions--stack`
* `.o-actions--wrap`

What it should do:

* `display: flex`
* gap / wrapping / alignment only
* no colors
* no borders
* no button padding
* no hover/focus styles

Why: your current hero and section CTA wrappers are structural containers, not buttons themselves. For example, `c-hero__actions` and `c-section-cta` are wrappers around links/buttons, so they could stay component-specific, or be abstracted later into one shared layout object if repetition grows.  

If you want to stay simple right now, **skip this file**.

## 2) `5-components/_button.scss` — shared button system

This should be your main reusable button file.

Put here:

* `.c-button`
* `.c-button--primary`
* `.c-button--secondary`
* `.c-button--small`
* `.c-button--large` only if needed later
* `.c-button--with-icon`
* `.c-button__icon-circle`
* `.c-button__icon`
* `.c-button__label`

Used by:

* hero primary CTA
* hero secondary CTA
* homepage “View All Projects” CTA

Those selectors already exist in your markup. The hero uses the full shared button system, including icon variants and size modifiers, while `index.html` uses the simpler primary button.  

What belongs here:

* inline-flex alignment
* padding
* border radius
* font weight / size
* background / border / text colors
* hover, focus-visible, active, disabled styles
* icon spacing and alignment

What does **not** belong here:

* page-specific placement
* hero-only spacing around the button group

---

## 3) `5-components/_theme-toggle.scss`

This should be its own component file, not part of generic buttons.

Put here:

* `.c-theme-toggle`
* `.c-theme-toggle--mobile`
* `.c-theme-toggle__icon`
* `.c-theme-toggle__icon--sun`
* `.c-theme-toggle__icon--moon`
* `.c-theme-toggle__label`

Related attribute hooks you may style carefully here if needed:

* `.c-theme-toggle[aria-pressed="true"]`
* `.c-theme-toggle[aria-pressed="false"]`
* `.c-theme-toggle[data-theme-toggle]`

Why separate it from `_button.scss`:

* it is a special-purpose control
* it has two icons and a stateful pressed mode
* it appears in both desktop header and mobile menu contexts

This is a standalone button include with its own markup and state behavior. 

---

## 4) `5-components/_nav-toggle.scss`

Make the mobile menu trigger its own file.

Put here:

* `.c-nav-toggle`
* `.c-nav-toggle__icon`

Related state/attribute selectors:

* `.c-nav-toggle[aria-expanded="true"]`
* `.c-nav-toggle[aria-expanded="false"]`
* `.c-nav-toggle[data-nav-toggle]`

Why separate:

* it is a header-specific control
* it has toggle state
* it should be easy to find when debugging header/mobile behavior

This button lives in `header.html` and controls `#mobile-menu` through `aria-controls`. 

---

## 5) `5-components/_mobile-menu.scss`

Keep the close button inside the mobile menu component file rather than making a separate close-button file.

Put here:

* `.c-mobile-menu`
* `.c-mobile-menu__inner`
* `.c-mobile-menu__top`
* `.c-mobile-menu__close`
* `.c-mobile-menu__close-symbol`
* `.c-mobile-menu__footer`

Related selectors:

* `.c-mobile-menu[hidden]`
* `.c-mobile-menu[data-mobile-menu]`

Why:

* the close button is tightly tied to the mobile menu shell
* it is not a reusable generic button pattern yet

The close control is clearly part of the mobile menu component. 

---

## 6) `5-components/_icon-link.scss`

Use this for icon-only action links, including social links and CV link styling if they share the same visual language.

Put here:

* `.c-icon-link`
* `.c-icon-link__icon`

Used through `social-links.html`, which is included in both header and footer and inside the mobile menu. Those are not semantic `<button>` elements, but visually they are action controls and belong in components. `footer.html` and `header.html` both reuse `c-social-links`, which delegates to `social-links.html`.   

I would then let your social-links component file handle layout/context, while `_icon-link.scss` handles the base clickable UI.

---

## 7) `5-components/_social-links.scss`

This should remain separate from `_icon-link.scss`.

Put here:

* `.c-social-links`
* `.c-social-links--mobile`
* `.c-social-links--footer`
* `.c-social-links__item`
* `.c-social-links__item--cv`

Why:

* `c-social-links` is a group/list component
* `c-icon-link` is the individual clickable control
* that split is cleaner and more maintainable

This grouping pattern is already implied by the includes in header, footer, and mobile menu.   

---

## 8) `5-components/_post-share.scss`

Keep all share-action styles together here.

Put here:

* `.c-post-share`
* `.c-post-share__list`
* `.c-post-share__item`
* `.c-post-share__link`
* `.c-post-share__icon`

JS/state hooks that can stay in this file if needed:

* `.js-print-btn`
* `.js-share-btn`

Why:

* this component mixes anchor actions and real buttons
* all of them share the same visual control class: `.c-post-share__link`

That shared action class is used on both `<a>` and `<button>`, which is a strong sign this is its own self-contained component rather than part of generic buttons.  

---

## 9) `5-components/_projects-filter.scss`

Treat filter chips as their own component, not as generic buttons.

Put here:

* `.c-projects-filter`
* `.c-projects-filter__inner`
* `.c-projects-filter__chip`
* `.c-projects-filter__chip.is-active`

Why:

* these are navigational filter chips
* they are visually button-like, but semantically links
* they belong to the projects archive UI, not the global button system

Your `projects.html` already uses this as a dedicated component. 

---

## 10) Leave these out of the shared button system for now

I would **not** move these into `_button.scss` yet:

* `.c-post-card__tag`
* `.c-post__tag`
* `.c-tag`
* `.c-nav__link`

Why:

* they may look pill-like or clickable
* but they belong to their own components semantically and structurally
* abstracting too early usually makes the SCSS harder to reason about

For example, `c-post-card__tag` is part of the post card component, not a reusable site-wide button pattern. 
Likewise, `c-tag` in `page.html` is just a content label right now.

## Recommended folder result

A clean setup would be:

```text
_sass/
  4-objects/
    _actions.scss            # optional, layout-only

  5-components/
    _button.scss
    _theme-toggle.scss
    _nav-toggle.scss
    _mobile-menu.scss
    _icon-link.scss
    _social-links.scss
    _post-share.scss
    _projects-filter.scss
```

---

## Recommended order to build them

1. `_button.scss`
2. `_theme-toggle.scss`
3. `_nav-toggle.scss`
4. `_mobile-menu.scss`
5. `_icon-link.scss`
6. `_social-links.scss`
7. `_post-share.scss`
8. `_projects-filter.scss`

Why this order:

* shared button first
* then header/mobile controls
* then smaller action-link components
* then page-specific chip/filter UI

---

## My concrete recommendation

For your project, I would do this:

* **Do not put actual button styling in `4-objects`**
* Put the reusable CTA system in **`5-components/_button.scss`**
* Keep special controls in their own component files
* Only add a `4-objects/_actions.scss` later if you notice repeated layout-only action wrappers

That gives you the cleanest Jekyll-first and ITCSS-correct structure for what you already have in the templates.      

Next I can draft the actual **`_button.scss` selector skeleton** in your ITCSS comment style.
